# HealthCore Integration Fixes

## Issues Resolved

### 1. CORS Policy Errors ✅
**Problem**: Backend was blocking frontend requests due to CORS policy restrictions.

**Solution**: Updated `backend/main.py` to include all common Vite dev server ports (5173-5175) in the CORS allowed origins list.

### 2. Missing Logo File ✅
**Problem**: Frontend was trying to load a non-existent `logo.svg` file causing 404 errors.

**Solution**: Created a molecular-themed SVG logo at `frontend/src/assets/logo.svg`.

### 3. Test Script Freezing ✅
**Problem**: The `test-integration.sh` script would freeze when the frontend started on a different port.

**Solution**: 
- Added dynamic port detection in the test script
- Extended wait time for frontend startup
- Added visual feedback during startup

### 4. API Connection Failures ✅
**Problem**: Multiple duplicate API calls and no graceful handling of backend unavailability.

**Solution**:
- Added retry logic with exponential backoff to API service
- Implemented proper cleanup in React components to prevent duplicate calls
- Added offline mode with demo data fallback
- Better error messages for connection failures

## How to Run

### Option 1: Use the new start script (Recommended)
```bash
./start-healthcore.sh
```
This script automatically cleans up existing processes on the required ports.

### Option 2: Use the test integration script
```bash
./test-integration.sh
```

### Option 3: Run services manually
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Offline Mode

The application now supports offline mode when the backend is unavailable:
- Demo missions are provided for testing
- Error messages are user-friendly
- The app remains functional for UI testing

## Port Configuration

- Backend: `http://localhost:8000`
- Frontend: `http://localhost:5173` (or 5174/5175 if 5173 is in use)
- API Documentation: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Port conflicts**: Use `./start-healthcore.sh` which automatically kills processes on required ports
2. **CORS errors**: Ensure the backend is running and check the browser console for the exact origin being used
3. **Connection errors**: Verify both services are running by checking the URLs above
4. **Module errors**: Run `npm install` in the frontend directory
