# Module 5: Requirements Calculator Module - FINALIZED

## Module Purpose
The Requirements Calculator Module serves as a **pure calculation service** that determines daily nutritional requirements for each body system based on individual factors and seasonal adjustments. It provides stable, research-based targets that other modules can depend on.

## ✅ ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: Pure Calculation Service

**Core Principle**: Same inputs always produce same outputs. No state, no memory, no dynamic adjustments during the day.

### What This Module Does
- Calculate personalized daily requirements based on user demographics
- Apply seasonal adjustments (real requirement changes like Vitamin D in winter)
- Provide precise nutrient targets for backend analytics
- Generate simplified groupings for frontend display
- Maintain research-backed consistency across all calculations

### What This Module Does NOT Do
- ❌ Track user progress or completion
- ❌ Adjust for cannabis usage (handled by Nutrient Vector Module)
- ❌ Handle weekly rotation focus (handled by Vector Coordination)
- ❌ Store or remember previous calculations
- ❌ Modify requirements based on daily intake

## Core Functionality

### 1. **Pure Calculation Architecture**
```python
class RequirementsCalculator:
    """Pure calculation service - stateless and predictable"""
    
    def calculate_daily_requirements(
        self, 
        user_profile: UserProfile,
        date: DateContext,
        seasonal_factors: SeasonalFactors
    ) -> DailyRequirements:
        """
        Pure function: same inputs always give same outputs
        No side effects, no state changes, no storage
        """
        # Base requirements from research
        base = self._get_research_based_requirements(user_profile.demographics)
        
        # Seasonal adjustments (real requirement changes)
        seasonal = self._apply_seasonal_adjustments(base, seasonal_factors)
        
        return seasonal
    
    def get_simplified_display_groups(
        self,
        daily_requirements: DailyRequirements
    ) -> SimplifiedDisplayGroups:
        """
        Convert precise nutrient targets into 3-4 user-friendly groups per system
        """
        return self._group_nutrients_for_display(daily_requirements)
```

### 2. **Research-Based Personalization Factors**

**Tier 1: Essential Demographics (Implemented)**
- **Age**: Affects absorption efficiency, metabolic rate
- **Gender**: Hormonal differences, RDA variations  
- **Body Weight**: Scaling factor for dosage calculations
- **Activity Level**: Antioxidant needs, hydration multipliers

**Tier 2: Seasonal Adjustments (Real Requirement Changes)**
- **Vitamin D**: Higher needs in winter months
- **Hydration**: Increased needs in summer heat
- **Immune Support**: Higher antioxidant needs during flu season
- **Geographic**: Altitude, latitude-based adjustments

**Calculation Example:**
```python
def calculate_base_requirement(nutrient, user_profile, seasonal_factors):
    # Start with RDA baseline
    base = RDA_VALUES[nutrient][user_profile.gender][user_profile.age_group]
    
    # Weight scaling (if applicable)
    if WEIGHT_SCALABLE_NUTRIENTS[nutrient]:
        weight_factor = user_profile.weight / REFERENCE_WEIGHTS[user_profile.gender]
        base *= weight_factor
    
    # Activity scaling for specific nutrients
    if user_profile.activity_level == "high":
        base *= ACTIVITY_MULTIPLIERS.get(nutrient, 1.0)
    
    # Seasonal adjustments (real requirement changes)
    if seasonal_factors.season == "winter" and nutrient == "vitamin_d":
        base *= 1.5  # Higher vitamin D needs in winter
    
    return base
```

### 3. **Sophisticated Backend, Simple Frontend**

- **Optimal Nutrition Research**: Higher ranges for specific nutrients
- **Bioavailability Studies**: Absorption and utilization factors
- **Population Studies**: Demographic variation data

## Testing Strategy

### Pure Function Testing
```python
def test_requirements_calculation_deterministic():
    """Same inputs should always produce same outputs"""
    profile = create_test_profile(age=30, gender="female", weight=65)
    seasonal = create_test_seasonal(season="winter", latitude=45.0)
    
    result1 = calculator.calculate_daily_requirements(profile, date(2025, 1, 15), seasonal)
    result2 = calculator.calculate_daily_requirements(profile, date(2025, 1, 15), seasonal)
    
    assert result1 == result2  # Must be identical
    
def test_seasonal_adjustments():
    """Vitamin D should be higher in winter"""
    profile = create_test_profile()
    winter = create_seasonal(season="winter")
    summer = create_seasonal(season="summer")
    
    winter_reqs = calculator.calculate_daily_requirements(profile, date(2025, 1, 15), winter)
    summer_reqs = calculator.calculate_daily_requirements(profile, date(2025, 7, 15), summer)
    
    winter_vit_d = winter_reqs.get_nutrient_target("vitamin_d")
    summer_vit_d = summer_reqs.get_nutrient_target("vitamin_d")
    
    assert winter_vit_d.target_amount > summer_vit_d.target_amount
```

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- Results are cache-friendly (pure functions)
- Cache by (user_profile_hash, date, seasonal_factors_hash)
- Daily cache expiration acceptable
- Memory usage minimal (no persistent state)

### Optimization
- Pre-compute common demographic combinations
- Lazy load research data
- Efficient nutrient grouping algorithms
- Minimal object creation in hot paths

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Basic Personalization (Immediate)
- Age, gender, weight, activity level scaling
- RDA baseline with optimal range adjustments
- Simple seasonal factors (vitamin D, hydration)
- 3-4 simplified groups per system

### Phase 2: Enhanced Seasonal (Month 2)
- Geographic location integration
- Daylight hour calculations
- Temperature-based adjustments
- Immune season support

### Phase 3: Advanced Personalization (Month 3+)
- Genetic factors (if available)
- Health condition considerations
- Medication interaction awareness
- Advanced demographic modeling
