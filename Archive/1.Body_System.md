# Body System Module - Detailed Discussion

## Module Overview
The Body System Module is the scientific foundation of the nutrition tracking system, defining which body systems are targeted each day and the nutritional requirements for optimal function.

## Current Understanding
From the project documents, the weekly rotation is:
- Monday: Cardiovascular
- Tuesday: Detox
- Wednesday: Brain
- Thursday: Immune
- Friday: Digestive
- Weekend: Recovery & Balance

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. Research Foundation
**Questions to Address:**
- What scientific literature supports this specific weekly rotation?
- Should we map each system to specific nutritional research papers?
- Why this order (e.g., why Cardiovascular on Monday vs another day)?
- Should we consider circadian rhythms or weekly biological cycles?

**Considerations:**
- Need peer-reviewed sources for each body system's nutritional needs
- Document the rationale for the weekly sequence
- Consider if order impacts effectiveness

### 2. Body System Definitions
**For each system, we need:**
- Clear biological markers (what defines a "healthy" cardiovascular system?)
- Specific nutrients that support it (nitrates for cardiovascular, but what else?)
- Measurable outcomes (better workouts, clearer skin, etc.)
- Contraindications or special considerations

**Example Structure:**
```
Cardiovascular System:
- Biomarkers: Blood pressure, resting heart rate, VO2 max
- Key Nutrients: Nitrates, Omega-3s, Potassium, Magnesium
- Food Examples: Beets, leafy greens, fatty fish, nuts
- Expected Outcomes: Better endurance, lower BP, improved recovery
- Research: [Citation needed]
```

### 3. Flexibility vs Structure
**Design Decisions:**
- Fixed weekly rotation (simpler for ADHD users)?
- Customizable schedules based on individual needs?
- Seasonal adjustments (immune focus in winter)?
- How to handle missed days or catch-up scenarios?

**ADHD Considerations:**
- Routine is helpful but rigidity can cause anxiety
- Need clear defaults with optional customization
- Visual consistency across days

### 4. Data Structure
**Proposed Structure:**
```python
class BodySystem:
    name: str
    day_of_week: int
    primary_nutrients: List[Nutrient]
    biomarkers: List[Biomarker]
    expected_outcomes: List[Outcome]
    research_references: List[Reference]
    
class Nutrient:
    name: str
    daily_target: float
    unit: str
    food_sources: List[FoodSource]
    absorption_factors: List[str]
    
class FoodSource:
    name: str
    serving_size: str
    nutrient_density: float
    preparation_notes: str
```

### 5. Integration Points
**This module needs to inform:**
- Food recommendations (which foods for which system)
- Requirements calculations (how much of each nutrient)
- Progress tracking (are you hitting system-specific goals)
- Shopping list generation (what to buy for the week)
- Cannabis interaction adjustments

**Key Interfaces:**
- `get_body_system_for_date(date) -> BodySystem`
- `get_nutrients_for_system(system) -> List[Nutrient]`
- `get_food_recommendations(system, restrictions) -> List[Food]`

### 6. Scientific Validity
**Requirements:**
- Each system-nutrition link must have research backing
- Sources should be recent (within 5-10 years)
- Consider meta-analyses over single studies
- Account for individual variation (genetics, lifestyle)

**Documentation Needs:**
- Research summary for each body system
- Nutrient interaction maps
- Update process for new research

### 7. User Experience for ADHD
**Critical Elements:**
- Clear, simple daily focus (one system at a time)
- Visual representation of which system is active
- Immediate feedback on food choices
- No overwhelming nutritional science in the UI

**Simplification Strategy:**
- Backend handles complexity
- Frontend shows "eat these 5 things today"
- Progress bars, not numbers
- Color coding for each system

## Open Questions
1. How do we validate the scientific accuracy of our system mappings?
2. Should we have a medical/nutrition expert review the module?
3. How often should we update based on new research?
4. How do we handle conflicting research findings?
5. Should cannabis interactions be part of this module or separate?

## Next Steps
- [ ] Compile research papers for each body system
- [ ] Define the minimal viable nutrient set for each system
- [ ] Create the data model in Python
- [ ] Design the research update process
- [ ] Plan integration with other modules
