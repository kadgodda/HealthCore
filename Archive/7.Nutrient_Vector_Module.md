# Module 7: Nutrient Vector Module - ENHANCED WITH COORDINATION COMPLEXITY

## Module Overview
The Nutrient Vector Module manages how nutrients are acquired and converted in the body, handling all the dynamic complexity that affects actual nutrient availability. It bridges the gap between what you consume (Food Tracking), what your body systems need (Requirements Calculator), and what your body actually gets (Progress Calculation).

## âœ… ENHANCED RESPONSIBILITY
This module now handles **ALL dynamic complexity** that was previously scattered across other modules:

### Core Responsibilities
1. **Calculate actual nutrient acquisition** from various pathways
2. **Apply cannabis impact** on absorption and conversion efficiency  
3. **Handle weekly rotation coordination** through temporal vector optimization
4. **Manage prerequisite tracking** for complex conversion pathways
5. **Coordinate timing and synergies** between nutrients and body systems
6. **Optimize acquisition strategies** based on user patterns

## ðŸ†• **Cannabis Integration (Moved from Module 5)**

Cannabis affects nutrient vectors, not requirements. It impacts how efficiently your body acquires and utilizes nutrients from food.

### Cannabis Impact on Acquisition Vectors

```python

## ðŸ†• **Weekly Rotation Coordination (Moved from Module 5)**

The weekly body system focus is handled through temporal coordination of vectors, not by changing requirements.

## ðŸ†• **Temporal Meta-Coordination**

Based on research from Vector Coordination Principles, we implement sophisticated timing patterns:
