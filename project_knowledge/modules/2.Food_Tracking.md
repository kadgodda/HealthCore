# Food Tracking Module - Detailed Discussion

## Module Overview
The Food Tracking Module is the primary user interaction point for logging nutritional intake. It focuses solely on recording what users consume and providing that data to other modules for processing.

## Key Discussion Points

### 1. **Core Tracking Functionality**

**Simplified Scope**: Food Tracking Module only tracks what you ate, when, and how much.

```python
class FoodEntry:
    """Core tracking data structure"""
    food_id: str  # From external API
    food_name: str
    entry_method: Literal["standard", "weight", "barcode"]
    
    # One of these will be populated
    standard_amount: Optional[float]  # "2" (medium apples)
    weight_grams: Optional[float]  # 364g
    barcode_scan: Optional[BarcodeScan]
    
    preparation_method: str  # "raw", "steamed", etc.
    timestamp: datetime
    meal_context: Optional[str]  # breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack
    
class BarcodeScan:
    barcode: str
    product_name: str
    brand: str
    servings_consumed: float  # Based on package serving size
    # OR
    grams_consumed: float  # If they weigh it
```

### 2. **Entry Methods**

**Three ways to log food:**

1. **Standard Serving**
   - Quick selection: "1 medium apple"
   - Pre-defined portions with gram estimates
   - Visual guides for portion sizes

2. **Weight-Based**
   - Enter exact grams
   - Most accurate method
   - Future: Smart scale integration

3. **Barcode Scanning**
   - Scan packaged products
   - Auto-populate serving info
   - Brand-specific nutrition data

### 3. **API Integration Strategy**

```python
class NutritionAPIService:
    """Abstracts nutrition data sources"""
    
    primary_api: str = "OpenFoodFacts"  # or USDA, Nutritionix
    fallback_apis: List[str] = ["USDA", "Nutritionix"]
    
    async def get_food_data(self, query: str) -> FoodData:
        # Try primary API
        # Fallback to secondary if needed
        # Cache results
        # Return standardized FoodData
        
    async def get_barcode_data(self, barcode: str) -> ProductData:
        # Check Instacart API
        # Fallback to other sources
        # Return product info
```

### 4. **Data Storage Schema**

```python
# Core Tables
user_food_entries:
    - id
    - user_id
    - timestamp
    - food_id  # External API reference
    - food_name  # Cached for offline
    - entry_method  # standard/weight/barcode
    - amount_value
    - amount_unit
    - preparation_method
    - meal_context
    - created_at

food_cache:
    - food_id  # From external API
    - api_source
    - nutrition_data_json
    - last_updated
    - search_terms[]  # For better search

user_frequent_foods:
    - user_id
    - food_id
    - use_count
    - last_used
    - custom_name  # User's nickname
```

### 5. **User Experience Considerations**

**Search & Selection:**
- Fuzzy search with typo tolerance
- Recent foods at top
- Frequent foods section
- Body system relevance indicators

**Quick Actions:**
- Copy yesterday's meals
- Save meal combinations
- Quick-add favorites
- Barcode history

### 6. **Integration with Other Modules**

#### Body System Module
- Provides list of nutrients needed for today's system
- Food Tracking shows foods rich in those nutrients
- No conversion calculations here

#### Nutrient Vector Module
- Receives food entries from Food Tracking
- Calculates actual nutrient acquisition
- Handles all conversion complexity

#### Interaction System Module (Optional)
- Receives food entries with timestamps
- Analyzes combinations and timing
- Returns interaction effects

#### Progress/Completion Module
- Gets food entries from Food Tracking
- Gets actual nutrients from Vector Module
- Calculates and displays progress

#### Requirements Calculator Module
- Sets personalized serving sizes
- Food Tracking uses these for "standard" servings
- Adjusts for user factors

#### Database Operations
- Store raw food entries
- Cache API responses
- Track user's common foods
- Handle offline scenarios

## What Food Tracking DOES:
1. Records food consumption entries
2. Fetches nutritional data from external APIs
3. Stores preparation methods
4. Tracks timing of consumption
5. Provides food data to other modules

## What Food Tracking DOES NOT DO:
1. Calculate nutrient conversions (Vector Module)
2. Determine interactions between foods (Interaction Module)
3. Calculate progress toward goals (Progress Module)
4. Set nutritional requirements (Body System Module)
5. Personalize serving sizes (Requirements Calculator)

## Simple Data Flow:
```
User Input → Food Entry → External API → Nutrition Data → Store
                                                            ↓
                                                    Other Modules
```

## Next Steps

1. **Finalize Core Data Model**
   - [ ] Define exact FoodEntry fields
   - [ ] Standardize preparation methods list
   - [ ] Create meal context categories
   - [ ] Design timestamp requirements

2. **API Integration Research**
   - [ ] Compare API features and pricing
   - [ ] Test API response times
   - [ ] Evaluate data completeness
   - [ ] Design caching strategy

3. **MVP Feature Set**
   - [ ] Phase 1: Direct consumption tracking only
   - [ ] Define "standard servings" list
   - [ ] Create common foods shortcuts
   - [ ] Design simple search interface

4. **Module Interface Design**
   - [ ] Define data contracts with other modules
   - [ ] Create event types for progress updates
   - [ ] Plan error handling strategy
   - [ ] Document API surface

## Key Advantages of Simplified Approach

1. **Single Responsibility**: Just tracks what you ate
2. **Clean Interfaces**: Other modules handle complexity
3. **Fast Development**: Can build and test quickly
4. **Easy to Understand**: Users just log food
5. **Flexible**: Can add features without breaking core
6. **Reliable**: Less complexity = fewer bugs# Food Tracking Module - Detailed Discussion
