## Key Design Principles

### 1. **Progressive Building**
Each day builds on the previous, creating cumulative benefits rather than isolated interventions.

### 2. **Shared Shopping List**
Many foods appear multiple times throughout the week:
- Leafy greens (Monday, Wednesday, Thursday)
- Fatty fish (Monday, Thursday)
- Berries (Tuesday, Monday Week 2)
- Nuts and seeds (throughout)

### 3. **Natural Transitions**
- Energy systems early in the week when motivation is high
- Detox mid-week to clear and reset
- Brain/gut connection to start Week 2
- Structural support before the weekend

### 4. **Flexibility Built In**
- Each day has a primary and support focus
- Foods can overlap between days
- Weekend allows for social eating while maintaining benefits

### 5. **ADHD-Friendly Features**
- Clear daily themes that are memorable
- Visual/taste variety throughout the week
- Achievable daily goals
- Room for imperfection (supporting systems catch what primary might miss)

## Body System Foundation Summary

This bi-weekly rotation provides the scientific foundation for targeting interconnected body systems through nutrition. Each system has:
- Clear biomarkers to track
- Specific nutrients that support it
- Measurable outcomes (both immediate and long-term)
- Research-backed benefits with quantified impacts

The synergistic groupings ensure that:
- Shopping lists naturally overlap
- Daily variety prevents monotony
- Systems support each other throughout the week
- Users build on previous days' benefits

This serves as the core reference for all other modules to build upon.
