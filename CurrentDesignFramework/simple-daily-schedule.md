# Simple Daily Supplement & Food Schedule - Safety First

## Core Principle: When in doubt, space it out!

## Daily Schedule

### **6:00-6:30 AM - Wake Up**
- **Drink water first** (16-20 oz)
- **Take Shilajit** on empty stomach
- Wait 30 minutes before eating or taking anything else

### **7:00-8:00 AM - Breakfast**
- **Eat breakfast** (include some healthy fats)
- **Take with breakfast:**
  - Vitamin D (needs fat for absorption)
  - Fish Oil (half your daily dose)
- **DO NOT take B-complex yet** (wait 2 hours)

### **10:00 AM - Mid-Morning**
- **Take B-Complex** (away from breakfast minerals)
- Have water or herbal tea

### **12:00-1:00 PM - Lunch**
- **Eat lunch** (your largest meal if possible)
- **Take remaining Fish Oil** with meal
- Good time for iron-rich foods if you eat them

### **3:00-4:00 PM - Afternoon**
- **Take Zinc** (empty stomach or with small snack)
- Stay hydrated

### **6:00-7:00 PM - Dinner**
- **Eat dinner**
- No supplements with dinner
- Good time for calcium-rich foods (since zinc was earlier)

### **8:30-9:00 PM - Evening**
- **Take Magnesium** (at least 2 hours after dinner)
- This helps with sleep

### **Bedtime**
- No supplements
- Just water if needed

## Simple Food Rules

### **Foods That Block Absorption (Avoid near supplements):**
- **Coffee/Tea**: Wait 1 hour after taking any supplements
- **Dairy**: Keep 2 hours away from iron or zinc
- **High-fiber foods**: Can trap minerals - eat separately from supplement times
- **Spinach/Chocolate**: High oxalates - don't combine with mineral supplements

### **Foods That Help Absorption (Pair with supplements):**
- **Vitamin C foods** (citrus, peppers): Great with iron
- **Healthy fats** (avocado, nuts): Needed for vitamins A, D, E, K
- **Fermented foods**: Generally help everything

## Weekly Cycling (Simple Version)

### **Monday-Friday**: Full supplement schedule
### **Saturday**: Only take Magnesium
### **Sunday**: No supplements (let your body reset)

## Red Flags - Stop and Reassess If:
- Nausea after supplements
- Metallic taste in mouth
- Digestive upset
- Extreme fatigue
- Skin reactions

## Quick Reference Timing Rules

**Always Space These Apart:**
- Calcium ↔ Iron: 2+ hours
- Zinc ↔ Copper: 2+ hours  
- Coffee ↔ Any supplement: 1+ hour
- High-fiber meal ↔ Minerals: 2+ hours

**Can Take Together:**
- All fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K)
- B-vitamins together
- Vitamin C + Iron
- Vitamin D + Magnesium

## Simplified Supplement List

1. **Shilajit**: Empty stomach, 30 min before food
2. **Vitamin D + Fish Oil**: With breakfast fats
3. **B-Complex**: Mid-morning alone
4. **Zinc**: Afternoon alone
5. **Magnesium**: Evening alone

## Monthly Pattern

- **Weeks 1-3**: Follow schedule
- **Week 4**: Take only Magnesium daily, skip others
- This prevents your body from becoming dependent

## Emergency Simplification

If this still feels too complex, here's the bare minimum:

**Morning**: Shilajit → Wait 30 min → Breakfast + Vitamin D
**Afternoon**: Zinc (away from meals)
**Evening**: Magnesium before bed

That's it! Better to do less correctly than more incorrectly.

## Remember:
- **Water is your friend** - drink throughout the day
- **Real food first** - supplements fill gaps, they don't replace meals
- **Listen to your body** - if something feels wrong, stop
- **Consistency beats perfection** - better to take supplements safely 80% of the time than perfectly 20% of the time

## Quick "Can I take this now?" Checklist:
1. Has it been 2+ hours since calcium/dairy? ✓
2. Has it been 1+ hour since coffee/tea? ✓  
3. Am I taking it with the right food (or empty stomach)? ✓
4. Am I hydrated? ✓

If all boxes checked → Take it!
If any box unchecked → Wait a bit longer

**This schedule prioritizes safety and avoiding negative interactions over maximum efficiency. Once you're comfortable with this routine, you can optimize further.**
